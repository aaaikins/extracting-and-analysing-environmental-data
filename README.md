# extracting-and-analysing-environmental-data
 This Python project involves extracting and analyzing data from two large CSV files: Goldie2019.csv and MLRCWeather2019.csv. The data originates from the Goldie buoy on Great Pond and the weather center at the Maine Lakes Resource Center, both recording information at 15-minute intervals.
